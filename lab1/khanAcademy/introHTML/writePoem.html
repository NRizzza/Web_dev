        <h1>POEM </h1>
        <p> You are not what you look like<br>
            You're the music you listen to, the shows you watch, the art you make, the flowers in your hair, and your favorite blanket.<br>
            You're not the pimple on your nose or the pudge on your tummy. <br>
            You're not your thighs or your teeth. You are the color ofyour hair. You're the mismatched socks you wear and your favorite sweater.<br>
            You're not what you look like or the body you are in. <br>
            <strong><em>You are what you love.</em></strong><br>
        </p>
